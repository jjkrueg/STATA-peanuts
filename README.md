# Small STATA packages
This is my place for small packages that I coded while working as an RA to make my life a little easier with large amounts of data. 

## wmc

This is a small STATA package that can be interpreted as an extension to the _mdesc_ command in STATA and allows for weights when investigating missing values. You specify the variables for which you want to see the number of missing values and then specify the variable by which you want to weight the missingness. This allows researchers to see that if a variable misses 5% of its observations whether when weighted this corresponds to 1% or 50% of another variable indicating how important the missing values are.
